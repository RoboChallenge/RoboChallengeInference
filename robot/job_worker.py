    Handles the processing of a single job, including status checking, robot starting,
    state polling, inference, and action posting.

    Args:
        client: An instance of the InterfaceClient for interacting with the job system.
        gpu_client: An inference client that wraps the policy/model for decision-making.
        job_id (str): The unique identifier for the job to process.
        robot_id (str): The unique identifier for the robot associated with the job.
        image_size (list): The size of images to request from the robot (e.g., [224, 224]).
        image_type (list): The types of images to request (e.g., ["high", "left_hand", "right_hand"]).
        action_type (str): The type of action to perform (e.g., "joint").
        duration (float): The duration for each action command.
        max_wait (int, optional): Maximum time to wait for job completion in seconds. Defaults to 600.

    Notes:
        - This function should not be modified by users.
        - It performs the main job loop for a single job, including error handling and logging.
